# Generative AI Projects

This repository is a collection of hands-on Generative AI and LLM-based projects built for learning, experimentation, and real-world application.

Each project is self-contained with its own code, dependencies, and documentation.

## Projects

### 1. Financial Data Extractor

### 2. RAG URL Answer Bot
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that:
- Ingests content from web URLs
- Stores embeddings in a vector database (Chroma)
- Uses an LLM to answer questions grounded in source content

## Notes

- Each project manages its own dependencies and runtime artifacts.
- Environment variables and API keys are managed via `.env` files.
- Vector databases, caches, and environment variables are generated locally and are not committed.
- This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration.
